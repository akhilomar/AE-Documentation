                            Adobe After Effects is use to implement motion graphics along with effects. Basically it is used to represents 2D motion. However it has options for 3D animation which is extended with interface of Maxon Cinema 4D.
                            After Effects can also be used for realistic efffects under VFX such as camera tracking, particle effects, wind control, light effects, masking and lot more. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After Effects used to create animations for explainatory videos under motion graphics, for creating UI/UX model and mostly it is used for advertisement purpose. Use of After can be extended to more platform based animations. For example: 
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Interface with Adobe illustrator provides excess with different paths and shapes which ease the animation and provides more mesmerizing results.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Interface with Maxon Cinema 4d or with different 3D redering and modelling softwares such as Blender, 3D Max, Nuke, Houdini, Maya etc. will provides better and smooth experience with 3D motions and animations including camera tracking.</li>

                                            <strong>A</strong>fter effects is basically implementations of final effects. As name suggest editing after effects. The basic animation of After Effects includes things which makes imaginative things more real and smoooth.</p>

                                                   To get started with AE, you have to create your first composition.
                                                   Open After effects go to Composition on navbar and click on Composition to creatre new compostion. 
                                                   You can also create composition by pressing CTRL+N

                                                            <li>Hand Tool</li>

                                                            <li>Selection Tools</li>

Use as many layers as necessary to create your composition. Some compositions contain thousands of layers, whereas some compositions contain only one layer.</p>
                                                                   <p>Layers in After Effects are similar to tracks in Adobe Premiere Pro. The primary difference is that each After Effects layer can have no more than one footage item as its source, whereas a Premiere Pro track typically contains multiple clips. Layers in After Effects are also similar to layers in Photoshop, though the interface for working with layers differs. Working with layers in the Timeline panel in After Effects is similar to working with layers in the Layers panel in Photoshop.</p>

A typical composition includes multiple layers that represent components such as video and audio footage items, animated text and vector graphics, still images, and lights. You add a footage item to a composition by creating a layer for which the footage item is the source. You then arrange layers within a composition in space and time, and composite using transparency features to determine which parts of underlying layers show through the layers stacked on top of them.</p>

Precomposing layers places them in a new composition, which replaces the layers in the original composition. The new nested composition becomes the source for a single layer in the original composition. The new composition appears in the Project panel and is available for rendering or use in any other composition. You can nest compositions by adding an existing composition to another composition, just as you would add any other footage item to a composition. Precomposing a single layer is useful for adding transform properties to a layer and influencing the order in which elements of a composition are rendered.</p>

This can be for position (shortcut = P), scale (S), rotation (R), opacity (T), anchor point (A), or other properties in effects and plugins. Typically, at least two keyframes are used to create a change with a property’s value over time. One is placed at the beginning of your change, and one at the end with the new value.</p>

You can then apply that animation preset to any other layer.</p>

Many new After Effects artists conclude that this must mean that Anchor Point and Position do the same thing, but this is simply not the case.</p>
